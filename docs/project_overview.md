# TechNova Solutions Enterprise Network Project

## Project Summary

This project presents the design and implementation of a simulated enterprise network infrastructure for TechNova Solutions, a mid-sized technology company. The network is designed to be scalable, secure, and reliable, supporting multiple departments with centralized network services. The project demonstrates practical skills in network planning, VLAN segmentation, dynamic routing, security implementation, and high-availability design using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Project Objectives

- Design a scalable and secure enterprise network for multiple departments.  
- Implement VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing to isolate departmental traffic.  
- Configure dynamic routing using OSPF for efficient network communication.  
- Deploy centralized services including DHCP, DNS, and NAT.  
- Enforce security policies using ACLs, port security, and guest network isolation.  
- Simulate redundancy and fault tolerance to ensure high availability.  
- Document network design, configuration, and testing results comprehensively.

## Project Scope

**In-Scope:**
- Core, distribution, and access layer design.  
- VLAN configuration and inter-VLAN routing.  
- OSPF dynamic routing.  
- DHCP, DNS, and NAT configuration.  
- Security policies including ACLs and port security.  
- Redundant links and STP implementation.  
- Testing and validation of connectivity, security, and high availability.

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Wireless network design  
- VoIP or video conferencing systems  
- Remote VPN access configuration

## Tools and Technologies

- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco Routers and Switches (2960, 3560, ISR series)  
- VLANs and Trunking (802.1Q)  
- Inter-VLAN Routing (SVI or Router-on-a-Stick)  
- OSPF Dynamic Routing  
- DHCP and DNS Services  
- NAT / PAT  
- Access Control Lists (Standard & Extended)  
- Port Security and Spanning Tree Protocol

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this project, TechNova Solutions will have a fully simulated, professional-grade enterprise network that:
- Supports departmental segmentation and secure communication.  
- Provides centralized services for IP management and internet access.  
- Enforces security policies for sensitive data and guest access.  
- Demonstrates redundancy and high availability through STP and redundant links.  
- Includes full documentation for design, configuration, and testing.
